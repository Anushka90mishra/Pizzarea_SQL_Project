In this project I have used MySQL to analyze pizza shop data by using SQL queries to find out useful insighths from the data.

- The dataset encompasses various critical aspects of the restaurant's operations, including the names, prices, and categories of pizzas, along with detailed order information such as 
quantities ordered, order IDs, pizza IDs, and pizza type IDs etc.
- The primary objective of this project is to utilize MySQL for querying and analyzing the data to uncover 
actionable insights that can help the restaurant optimize its operations.
The specific goals include:
 1. Identifying Top Ordered Pizzas
 2. Revenue Analysis
 3. Category-wise distributions

**Questions:**
1. Most Ordered Pizza Size
2. Highest Priced Pizza
3. Total Quantity of Each Pizza Category Ordered
4. List of 5 most Ordered Pizza Types with their Quantities
5. istribution of Orders by Hour of the Day
6. The Average Number of Pizzas Ordered Per Day
7. The Percentage Contribution of Each Pizza Type to Total Revenue
8. Top 3 Most Ordered Pizza Types Based on Revenue
9. The Cumulative Revenue Generated Over Time
